As we did when importing other assets in previous chapters, you may need to convert the imported materials to the current render pipeline, by the following steps:

	1. Select Edit | Render Pipeline | Universal Render Pipeline | Upgrade Project Materials to URP Materials
	2. When prompted, click Proceed
	3. You may see messages in the Console window but all should go away when you press Clear
